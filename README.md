# Pastelog

PasteLog is a simple, fast, and powerful pastebin. It is powered by firebase in the backend.
It allows you to publish your logs, and access them from anywhere and any device via a unique link.

### Features

- The logs can be stored forever or can be set to expire after a certain duration
- You can import logs from pastelog or Github gist
- You can fork and publish logs
- Stores log locally for easy access
- Supports rich content with basic markdown (does not support inline HTML tags)
